# UFOs :alien:

## Overview 
In this analysis, Dana would like to further develop her web application by increasing the filtering capability.  Before completing this challenge, the table developed to display UFO sightings could only be filtered by date.  In some cases, there are many UFO observations on a particular date, meaning an end user would still have many data points to sift through.  Therefore, filters were created for four other criteria in the table: city, state, country, and shape.  This added capability could be particularly useful for someone who may only want to look at UFO sighting data in one state, or multiple cities within a state.
